🔬 TECHNIQUE COMPARISON
----------------------------------------

PATTERN BASED:
  Detection Rate: 0.50
  Precision: Unknown (requires ground truth)
  Recall: Unknown (requires ground truth)
  Advantages: Fast, Interpretable, No training required
  Disadvantages: Limited patterns, Easy to bypass, High false negatives

ML BASED:
  Detection Rate: 0.75
  Precision: High (reported in paper)
  Recall: High (reported in paper)
  Advantages: Learns complex patterns, Adaptable, High accuracy
  Disadvantages: Requires training data, Black box, Computational overhead

PROMPTMAP:
  Detection Rate: 0.50
  Precision: Medium (rule dependent)
  Recall: Medium (rule dependent)
  Advantages: Comprehensive rules, Specific techniques, Actively maintained
  Disadvantages: Rule maintenance, False positives, Limited to known patterns


💡 RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
1. **Multi-layered Defense**: Use combination of all three approaches
2. **Pattern-based**: First line of defense for known attacks
3. **ML-based**: Secondary validation for sophisticated attacks
4. **Promptmap**: Continuous testing and rule validation
5. **Consensus Approach**: Require 2+ techniques to agree for blocking
